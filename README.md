# ðŸ§¹ SQL Data Cleaning Project â€“ Layoffs Dataset

This project demonstrates real-world data cleaning using SQL on a tech layoffs dataset collected from Layoffs.fyi.  
It includes identifying and removing duplicates, handling nulls, standardizing data, and exporting a cleaned version of the dataset.

## ðŸ—‚ Files
- `layoffs.csv` â€“ Original raw data
- `Data Cleaning.sql` â€“ SQL queries for cleaning
- `cleaned_layoffs.csv` â€“ Final cleaned dataset

## ðŸ”§ Whatâ€™s Covered in SQL
- Duplicate removal using `ROW_NUMBER()` and CTEs
- Text standardization with `TRIM()`, `LIKE`, and `UPDATE`
- Handling null/missing values
- Column formatting and date conversion

## ðŸ’¡ Skills Demonstrated
- SQL data wrangling
- Use of CTEs and window functions
- String and date manipulations
- Real-world ETL logic for business data

## âœ… How to Use
You can run the SQL file step-by-step in MySQL Workbench or DBeaver to clean the dataset yourself.  
The final result is also exported as `cleaned_layoffs.csv`.
